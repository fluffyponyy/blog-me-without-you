  I asked for input on what to write about on this blog post; I was enlightened
  with the word "giraffes". They are very majestic animals. When I was young,
  perhaps 4 years old, I saw them at the zoo in Washington, DC. Since then I
  always believed giraffes were as tall as 6, 7 floor apartment buildings. When
  I looked at giraffe images at the start of my internet journey, I was
  disappointed to see their actual height. Maybe my tiny toddler statue biased
  me.

  I added quite a bit of CSS to the website today, including a lovely lime green
  gradient, inspired by <b> HTML Energy.</b> More to come on that!
