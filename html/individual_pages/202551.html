<div class=post><h2>Day 12</h2>
<p class="date"><i>May 1, 2025</i></p>

<p>Welcome to a new month. I hardly feel refreshed.</p>
<p>
  One thing I have noticed in the last month is that
  <b>avoiding fear doesn't benefit me.</b> This may sound obvious until you
  realize what mainstream culture encourages us to do in the face of fear. If
  you are feeling too stressed, too overwhelmed with your tasks, too burnt out,
  you must immediately rest and take a break. I understand the inclination to
  want to stop, and there are definitely times you should stop, but
  <b>not every moment of stress should lead to rest.</b> Sometimes you have to
  keep pressing on in the face of your fear of the task. I usually find it
  better to do things when I feel overwhelmed instead of taking a break- I will
  usually come back from that break feeling even more overwhelmed since I now
  have even less time to accomplish anything that day. Finishing things feels
  good.
