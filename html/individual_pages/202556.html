<div class=post><h2>Day 14</h2>
<p class="date"><i>May 6, 2025</i></p>

<p>
  Today I watched<i> La La Land </i>for the first time. It reminded me of other
  movies about love that I'd seen recently like
  <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>, <i>500 Days of Summer</i>, and
  <i>Past Lives</i>, and how they all portray love in a non-linear fashion.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The lead man in <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> re-experiences
  his past relationship as he tries to have memories of it removed from his
  brain. He relives these memories backwards, and as if he is experiencing them
  for the first time. Both characters in their couple have all their memories of
  each other erased. However, at the end of the film, when they learn what has
  happened and again relive their past relationship together, the two decide to
  try dating again. Their love happens over and over again, in chronological
  order and in reverse, and yet the movie suggests this as potentially
  strengthening it.
</p>
<p>
  <i>500 Days of Summer</i> jumps around in its narrative; they also do not let
  you see the couple's story unfold chronologically. You see the past and future
  interwoven. You learn who the characters are by sometimes seeing the
  consequences of their choices before they make them. What effect does this
  have on the audience understanding their love?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  While <i>Past Lives</i> only employs a brief usage of flashbacks and actual
  non-linear storytelling, the idea of experiencing a "past life" is what makes
  their love appear "non-linear". It is non-linear across dimensions, and this
  concept appears in <i>La La Land</i> too- their love story crosses through
  universes or "worlds", just like it crosses through time in the other two
  movies.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  I think the inherent nature of love is to be non-linear, or at least, that is
  how we like to imagine it. We like to think that the past references the
  future- much like in the chronological viewing of a film. We like to think
  that every moment matters, that it builds on itself in a way that we might not
  understand now, but we will in the future, somewhere down the line- or in
  another dimension. Ultimately, I believe that best way to go about life is
  thinking that
  <b>Love is a non-linear narrative.</b>
