<div class=post><h2>Day 10</h2>
<p class="date"><i>April 24, 2025</i></p>

<p>
  I grappled with acceptance today. I found a way to make room for all of the
  complicated feelings about my past decisions. It turns out I have a lot of
  room, actually. <br />
  Everyone has different little capacity containers for different things. If you
  get very close to the top or overfill your capacity, certainly some alarms
  will be activated and you can begin to feel burnout, exhaustion, or collapse.
  <br />
  What I wonder is, what happens if you aren't sufficiently filling your
  capacity? I imagine capacity as a stretchy membrane one can exercise, if one
  is aware of its existence. So if you aren't filling your capacity very much,
  perhaps it will shrink, and if you find yourself in a situation that
  <i>requires</i> your formerly high capacity, you will not succeed. <br />
  I also theorize that you may begin to feel unsatisfied if you are leaving
  yourself empty. Can the gape of unfilled space, things you have the potential
  of doing, especially where you might have above average potential, cause
  negative consequences? I believe so. You must try and use all that is given to
  you- and you should play with it! Allow yourself to explore the limits of all
  your capacities. Feel and push into every wall and see how it bends out of
  shape!
