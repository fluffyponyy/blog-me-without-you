<p>To Do list for this website includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use Python to generate `index.html` from a set of .txts automatically</li>
  <li>same for `quotes.html`</li>
  <li>create some sort of sidebar</li>
  <li>
    create a page that keeps track of frequently mentioned words or topics, like
    a word cloud page
  </li>
  <li>create an appealing and cohesive aesthetic</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Everytime I remember what I could have done better, what I could have changed,
  I feel a deep pull toward regret in my body. It is very difficult. To deal
  with the feelings held by the body, I will reply equally by moving my body and
  letting it express itself.

<p class="date"><i>April 7, 2025</i></p>
<p>This is day one of 'me without you'.</p>

<p>I am starting this blog for <b>two</b> primary reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To create my first personal repo & project on GitHub</li>
  <li>As a form of self expression during a strange time in my life.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  (Forgive my overuse of stylization; it feels like the "Hello World" of web
  development.)
</p>

<p>
  Today I went for a long walk in the rain. I haven't been having a particularly
  cheerful time. Maybe my next entry will be more interesting (although I prefer
  it when life is slightly boring).
</p>

<p>I leave with a quote that has been on my mind lately:</p>

<q cite="Andre Aciman, Call Me By Your Name">
  We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should
  that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and
  <u> have less to offer each time we start with someone new.</u> But to feel
  nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!
