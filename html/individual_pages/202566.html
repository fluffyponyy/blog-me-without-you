  I think I'm seeing the end of this blog project. I know 17 posts doesn't make
  for a particularly long or well-developed blog, but it served its purpose. I
  might still fix a bug in the individual pages. Otherwise, this really helped
  me get back into development, as simple as it was. It inspired me to
  <a href="https://itch.io/jam/besties-game-jam">host</a> and
  <a href="https://fluffyponyy.itch.io/nordle">participate in</a> a game jam. I
  found at least a shred of self-confidence by bearing myself and my work to my
  public GitHub, although no one reads my posts except my dutiful boyfriend.
  <br />
  I liked making this, but I wish to make things that are harder, more complex,
  involve more moving pieces and new technologies. This was fun, and it will
  remain on my GH for the time being.
  <br />
  Finally, I appreciate the journey I got to explore on this blog. A small but
  not irrelevant chapter of my life, spanning two months. I moved into a dorm
  room with view of Mount Baker and cargo ships across the Salish Sea. I visited
  a new city and accepted a co-op position there just a month later. I spent a
  lot of time with people, I worked on myself, and I made a few key choices that
  will impact the rest of my year and even my early 20's. I hope this pattern of
  significant change and effort will continue. I can decide to do things, and
  decide to follow through. I am not simply a victim of
