# blog-me-without-you
[A personal blog.](https://fluffyponyy.github.io/blog-me-without-you/)

# Description

I use this blog as a personal diary of reflections. You can view the long index page, view individual posts by date, or browse every quote I have posted within a blog post. <br>
This is a work in progress that I continually develop as I make blog posts. Certain features may be incomplete at any moment. <br>
I may "finish" the blog or stop posting at a moment where I feel the project is complete.

# Prototype

I first designed this blog using Canva, and this was the final iteration of my design. I aimed for a simple and clean layout, with a pistachio-chocolate dessert theme.
