          <h2>Day 1</h2>
          <p>This is day one of 'me without you'.</p>

          <p>I am starting this blog for <b>two</b> primary reasons:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>To create my first personal repo & project on GitHub</li>
            <li>As a form of self expression following my breakup</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            (Forgive my overuse of stylization; it feels like the "Hello World"
            of web development.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Today I went for a long walk in the rain. I haven't been having a
            particularly cheerful time. Maybe my next entry will be more
            interesting (although I prefer it when life is slightly boring).
          </p>

          <p>I leave with a quote that has been on my mind lately:</p>

          <q cite="Andre Aciman, Call Me By Your Name">
            We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we
            should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and
            <u> have less to offer each time we start with someone new.</u> But
            to feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!
