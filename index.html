  I thought about kintsugi today. How whenever you break something, you cannot
  ever put it back together regularly again. It is impossible to put it back to
  how it once was. Kintsugi, however, allows you to turn it into something new,
  something maybe beautiful.

  I had my wisdom teeth out on Monday. My mouth is very sore. I get to spend
  long hours at home and by myself. Strange that when I feel like I have a
  chance to fully unwind and mess around, it's due to a medical procedure.
</p>

<p>I saw Spider-man recently and it made me feel a bit inspired.</p>

      Sometimes I feel as if I've gone down the wrong timeline. I feel like
      somewhere down the line, I made a misstep or some strange decision that
      put me on a path far rockier and significantly different than the majority
      of the other, "regular" timelines. Although, perhaps everyone thinks this
      about their life; that it has taken some weird fork in the road, gone
      somewhere it should not. We usually do not get the things we desire in
      life.

<p>
  I spent a lot of today thinking about regret. I think this website is now too
  colorful to represent my true feelings right now.
</p>

<p>
  However, I ideally want this website to be about healing and progressing. So I
  spent time playing with my cat, I listened to two new albums, and I wrote in
  my journal. I tried. I really tried.
</p>

<p>Here's to another day.</p>
</div><div class=post><h2>Day 2</h2>
<p class="date"><i>April 8, 2025</i></p>
<div class="horizontal-break">* * *</div>

<p>To Do list for this website includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use Python to generate `index.html` from a set of .txts automatically</li>
  <li>same for `quotes.html`</li>
  <li>create some sort of sidebar</li>
  <li>
    create a page that keeps track of frequently mentioned words or topics, like
    a word cloud page
  </li>
  <li>create an appealing and cohesive aesthetic</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Everytime I remember what I could have done better, what I could have changed,
  I feel a deep pull toward regret in my body. It is very difficult. To deal
  with the feelings held by the body, I will reply equally by moving my body and
  letting it express itself.

<p>This is day one of 'me without you'.</p>

<p>I am starting this blog for <b>two</b> primary reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To create my first personal repo & project on GitHub</li>
  <li>As a form of self expression during a strange time in my life.</li>
</ul>

  development.)

  Today I went for a long walk in the rain. I haven't been having a particularly
  cheerful time. Maybe my next entry will be more interesting (although I prefer
  it when life is slightly boring).
</p>

<p>I leave with a quote that has been on my mind lately:</p>

<q cite="Andre Aciman, Call Me By Your Name">
  We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should
  that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and
  <u> have less to offer each time we start with someone new.</u> But to feel
  nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!
